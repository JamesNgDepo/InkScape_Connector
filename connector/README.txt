Inkscape Connector Extension
Overview

The Inkscape Connector Extension is a tool designed for Inkscape, a popular vector graphics editor. It allows users to draw lines with arrowheads and labels between selected objects within an SVG document. This extension is particularly useful for creating diagrams where distances between objects need to be visually represented and labeled.
Features

    Customizable Line Properties: Users can adjust the stroke width of the connector lines.
    Text Labels: The extension supports text labels to display measurements with customizable text size.
    Scalability: Users can scale the measurements according to their needs.
    Text Positioning: The extension allows for the adjustment of the text's position relative to the path.
